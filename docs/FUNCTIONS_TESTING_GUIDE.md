    LAST_ALTERED
FROM information_schema.ROUTINES
WHERE ROUTINE_SCHEMA = 'ski_resort'
AND ROUTINE_TYPE = 'FUNCTION'
ORDER BY ROUTINE_NAME;

## 6. Business Logic Validation

### 6.1 Verify Rental Pricing Logic

```sql
USE ski_resort;

-- Verify pricing matches function calculation
CALL sp_process_equipment_rental(1, 1, 5, @r1, @p1, @s1);

-- Calculate expected price using function
SELECT 
    @p1 AS procedure_price,

    CASE 
        WHEN @p1 = fn_calculate_rental_price('Ski', 5, 1) THEN 'MATCH'
        ELSE 'MISMATCH'
    END AS validation;
-- Expected: MATCH
```

### 6.2 Verify Refund Policy Logic

```sql
USE ski_resort;

-- Test refund calculation for different scenarios
SELECT 
    '>7 days (100%)' AS scenario,
    fn_calculate_ticket_refund(1, '2024-12-05') AS refund_amount,
    89.00 AS expected_amount,
    CASE 
        WHEN fn_calculate_ticket_refund(1, '2024-12-05') = 89.00 THEN 'CORRECT'
        ELSE 'INCORRECT'
    END AS validation
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    '5 days (50%)',
    fn_calculate_ticket_refund(1, '2024-12-10'),
    44.50,
    CASE 
        WHEN fn_calculate_ticket_refund(1, '2024-12-10') = 44.50 THEN 'CORRECT'
        ELSE 'INCORRECT'
    END
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    '2 days (25%)',
    fn_calculate_ticket_refund(1, '2024-12-13'),
    22.25,
    CASE 
        WHEN fn_calculate_ticket_refund(1, '2024-12-13') = 22.25 THEN 'CORRECT'
        ELSE 'INCORRECT'
    END
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Same day (0%)',
    fn_calculate_ticket_refund(1, '2024-12-15'),
    0.00,
    CASE 
        WHEN fn_calculate_ticket_refund(1, '2024-12-15') = 0.00 THEN 'CORRECT'
        ELSE 'INCORRECT'
    END;
```

### 6.3 Verify Equipment Status Updates

```sql
USE ski_resort;

-- Test that equipment status changes after rental
SELECT EquipmentID, Status AS status_before
FROM Equipment
WHERE EquipmentID = 1;

CALL sp_process_equipment_rental(1, 1, 5, @rental_id, @total_price, @status);

SELECT EquipmentID, Status AS status_after
FROM Equipment
WHERE EquipmentID = 1;
-- Expected: Status changed from 'Available' to 'Rented'
```
